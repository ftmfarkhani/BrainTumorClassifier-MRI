### An online platform for brain tumor classification using MRI images, 
enhanced with image modification techniques to improve detection accuracy for low-quality scans.

Purpose: Classifies brain images into categories using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

Frameworks Used: TensorFlow/Keras for model development; Albumentations for augmentation; Streamlit for interactive deployment.

Model Architecture: Utilizes InceptionV3, a powerful pre-trained CNN model.

Augmentation & Regularization: Includes advanced image augmentation techniques and dropout layers to mitigate overfitting.

Deployment: Integrated with Streamlit, enabling real-time image prediction in a web app.
